# Lecture 15: Oct 29
## Bezier Problems
- lack of local modification
- More control = higher degree
### Use more segsments of bezier curves
### Composite Bezier Curves
- P2, P3 and Q1 need to be colinear

### Piecewise Polynomials

## Wishlist for Curves
- Efficient Algorithm
- Local Modification
- Smooth
- Coordinate free

## How to get that?
- easy to compute
- Local support
- smooth
- N(u) Sum to one
