# Lecture 9: Oct 3
## 3D projection onto 2D
- viewing pipeline
- perspective projection
- mapping 3D to 2D
- Analogous to real photography

## Rigid Body Transformations
- Do not change the shape of the object
- Examples:
    - Rotation
    - Translation
## Conformal Transformations
- Preserve angles
- Examples:
    - *Uniform* Scaling

## Paralell Projection
- Simplest form of projection
- Focus of the camera is at infinity
